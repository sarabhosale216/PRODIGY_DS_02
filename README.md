# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship - Task 02

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

### 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to perform **Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships among various passenger attributes and survival outcomes.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Dataset:** Titanic Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
- **Files Used:**
  - train.csv
  - test.csv

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📋 Data Cleaning

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Checked dataset structure and data types.
- Identified missing values.
- Filled missing values in:
  - **Age** using the median value.
  - **Embarked** using the mode.
  - **Fare** using the median (if required).
- Removed the **Cabin** column due to a large number of missing values.
- Checked and removed duplicate records.
- Verified the dataset after cleaning.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The following visualizations were created:

- Survival Count
- Survival by Gender
- Survival by Passenger Class
- Age Distribution
- Fare Distribution
- Age vs Survival (Box Plot)
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pair Plot

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.
- Passengers traveling in First Class were more likely to survive than those in Second and Third Class.
- Most passengers were between 20 and 40 years of age.
- Higher ticket fares were generally associated with better survival chances.
- Passenger class and gender were the strongest factors influencing survival.
